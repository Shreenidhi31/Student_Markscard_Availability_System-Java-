# 🎓 Student Marks Card Availability System

This is a **mini project** developed during my **MCA** to explore full-stack web development using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The system allows college administrators to notify students about the arrival and collection of their marks cards, improving communication and reducing unnecessary college visits.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

In traditional college systems, students have to visit the college physically to check whether their marks cards have arrived. This causes inconvenience and delays. 
There is a need for a simple web-based system to provide real-time updates and notifications to students.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Remote Access**: Enable students to check marks card status online.
- **Notifications**: Allow admins to send timely updates to students.
- **Data Management**: Help college admins manage student records effectively.

## 🎓 About This Project

This project was developed as part of my **MCA mini project** to gain practical exposure to full-stack development using Java and related technologies. Through this project, I explored how to:
- Structure a Java Spring Boot web application
- Connect backend with a MySQL database
- Build basic user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Implement login and notification-based features

It helped me understand how frontend and backend systems interact in a real-world web application.
